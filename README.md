Project for CS 224N and CS 129 at Stanford University. Philip Baillargeon, Nate Cadicamo, Javokhir Arifov.

This repo is not sufficient for retraining our model. It is more just a demonstration of what our project is, highlighting in particular some of my personal coding contributions.

This project was built on the Anticipatory Music Transformer, a project by John Thickstun et. al. Please see their website, paper and code here: https://crfm.stanford.edu/2023/06/16/anticipatory-music-transformer.html,
